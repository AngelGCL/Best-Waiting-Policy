# Best-Waiting-Policy
This is a Data Structures course project that I completed. It tests different waiting policies that can be used by a business. (The way clients make a line while waiting to be attended.)
<p>To use:<\p>
Run the FileGeneratorMain class to generate the files needed to run the program. (NOTE: You will have to create a inputFiles directory in the same directory of the src directory)
Run the DataReaderMain class to read the files and return the results. (NOTE: You will have to create a outputFiles directory in the same directory as the src directory)
